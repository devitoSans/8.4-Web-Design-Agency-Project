# Web Design Agency Project

This is my first, and very simple, (pure) HTML and CSS project. It is created for understanding more on the concept of responsiveness in CSS and replicating a design in one 
of the Udemy's course. In order to build a responsive website, this project still uses 
[Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) instead of utilizing other tools such as 
[Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout), 
[Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox), 
and even an external framework: [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
